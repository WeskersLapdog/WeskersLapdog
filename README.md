BYI
 - I don't talk on ponytown, I prefer just making facial expression + nodding/shaking head etc.
 - If my pony has 'nonverbal' in the name it means I'm in a bad spot mentally and would prefer to be left alone (whipsering is okay; just dont expect a response back)
 - I don't rp, so don't ask
 - I usually just lurk, meaning I'm just watching whats going on around me or I'm offtab
 - I don't mind if you come up and cuddle/hug/kiss whatever, it's fine!
 - If you whisper me just know I don't get whispered often, so I may be slow to respond
 - Wesker is a HUGE comfort character for me, most ponies will have a plush of him on my head, this does NOT mean I ship Wesker with the pony I'm currently wearing

DNI 
 - Basic DNI criteria (homophobes/pedos/etc.)
 - REBESKER SHIPPERS
 - Trolls (I hide freely so you're wasting your time)
 - Ronnie Radke fans & Melanie Martinez fans
 - SOME Aeon Shippers (just not my cup of tea, it's fine if you like it, just don't try and force it down my throat if we're interacting)
